            <p>my practice aims to investigate transformation processes and facilitate spaces for collaborative learning and designing pasts, presents and futures. With a academic background in sociology, architectural- and speculative-design, I am passionate about understanding how (social) structures are embedded in ever-changing global environments and how collective responses to ongoing (climate) emergencies look like.<br> <br>
            I believe that exchange and discussion are key to opening up new possibilities of seeing and thinking and promoting heterogeneous coexistences.</p>

            <p><span style="color: #333015; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.3em;">about my position</span></p>
            <p>my name is Stella (she/her) - a transdisciplinary sociologist and artistic researcher. I was born and raised in Berlin as an able-bodied white cis person to a German mother and a Dutch father. Educated in Montessori and reform pedagogical schools, I have always tapped into different interests and passions. I have been involved in several development cooperation programmes dealing with human rights, especially education and the (re)construction and design of (social) infrastructure.<br><br>
            In my bachelor “Sociology” at the Universiteit van Amsterdam, I was drawn to the discussions on global social configurations that are constantly in making and transformation, especially in courses on intersectionality and philosophy of ethics. A few years ahead, at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie, I enjoyed the practical approach towards tackling (social)spaces – working digitally with various programs as well as getting involved in makerspaces. I engaged in decentralising the human from the design process, recognizing the interconnected wholeness of the worlds in which we find ourselves. I questioned status quo narratives and engaged in decolonial writing and practice. As part of various faculty bodies concerned with representing the needs of students and minority groups, I worked to resolve conflicting interests and mediate space for open dialogue and freedom of expression.<br><br>
            At the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia in Barcelona, I participated in the „Master in Design for Emergent Futures”, that focusses on speculating and prototyping alternative presents. I investigated transformational processes and potential future scenarios that address the intersection of human expression and creativity with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. I continue to work with narration and speculative fiction while trying to facilitate space for voices that are often being overheard in the societies I live in.</p><br><br>
            <p><span style="color: #333015; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.3em;">statement</span></p>
            <p>I think being part of the worlds I move in comes with a responsibility of finding tools and methods to help navigate the complexities that our neoliberal capitalist system imposes on its people. Together we need to develop a sense of belonging and caring - practices that facilitate spaces for sharing and imagining knowledges that do not yet exist. These spaces must draw on decolonial and ecofeminist thought to combat white heteropatriarchy and oppression.</p><br><br>
