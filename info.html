            <p>my name is Stella (she/her) - a transdisciplinary creative from Berlin with a background in sociology, arts and speculative design. My research practice addresses the intersections between social structures (e.g distributed knowledge systems), emergent technologies, and global transitions, focussing on bringing forward equity and healthy coexistence on this planet. Working within cultural- and creative entrepreneurship, i engage with design principles rooted in co-creation, open-source investigation and experience-centred research.<br> <br>
            dedicated to increasing global justice, i am passionate about everything dealing with creating and inhabiting spaces that span the world as interconnected web of thought-threads. Therefore, my practice aims to investigate transformation processes and facilitate spaces for collaborative learning â€“ i have a particular interest in distributed knowledge systems that emphasise Naturecultures in a web of more-than-human agency. How do we prototype just and sustainable cohabitations on Earth? i believe that by designing collaborative platforms for (re)framing futures, we establish agility within ever-changing environments.<br><br>
            as an able-bodied, white, cis person born to German and Dutch parents i am committed to challenging my comfort zones and broadening my perspectives with curiosity, care and respect.</p>

            <p>to me, being part of the worlds i move in comes with a responsibility of finding ways to help navigate its complexities. In community, we develop a sense of belonging and caring - practices that facilitate spaces for the co-creation and circulation of knowledge. Such spaces draw on decolonial and ecofeminist thought to combat white heteropatriarchy and oppression.</p><br><br>
